# fastest-roundest-pokemon

It's the roundest pokemon app, but it's ported to TanStack Start. And we're gradually adding optimizations.

## How to run

```
$ npm i
$ npm run dev
```

Go into your convex Dashboard:

```
$ npx convex dashboard
```

And run the `initDatabase` function to load up the pokemon. Then
you can go to `http://localhost:3000` and start voting.
